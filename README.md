## Project Overview

This project evaluates deep learning architectures for classifying physiological and behavioral patterns of individuals who use Anabolic Androgenic Steroids (AAS). The goal is to develop a system capable of identifying potential AAS users based on data related to body composition, muscle strength, and other relevant physiological indicators.

## Data Collection

The data used in this project was extracted from the study "Testosterone dose-response relationships in healthy young men" by Shalender Bhasin et al., published in the New England Journal of Medicine (1996). This study investigated the effects of anabolic steroid use in young men, divided into groups with and without physical exercise. Collected variables include body weight, fat-free mass, muscle areas (triceps and quadriceps), and strength. The database was organized from the study's tables for analysis and machine learning model training.

## Data Validation

The data was validated based on the results from the tables extracted from the Bhasin et al. (1996) study, which analyzed the effects of testosterone use compared to placebo in individuals who did or did not exercise. Key variables include body weight, fat-free mass, muscle areas, and strength in bench press and squat exercises.

## Model Selection and Training

A Random Forest model was chosen for this project due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its robustness in preventing overfitting, especially in complex datasets like those of steroid users. This algorithm, an ensemble of decision trees, offers superior performance in classification tasks, allowing for accurate pattern identification and variable importance analysis. Its interpretive nature also facilitates understanding the characteristics that most influence predictions, making it an ideal choice for creating an effective anti-doping system.

The model was trained on the collected data, with features including 'Group', 'Condition', and 'Value'. Categorical variables were converted to numerical format using one-hot encoding. The data was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Evaluation

The Random Forest model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation was also performed to assess the model's robustness.

The confusion matrix shows that the model achieved 100% accuracy, with no false positives or false negatives. This indicates that the model can perfectly classify users and non-users based on the provided data.

## Feature Importance

The analysis of feature importance revealed the variables that contributed most significantly to the model's performance. "Fat-free mass (kg)", "Bench-press exercise (kg lifted)", and "Quadriceps area (mm²)" were identified as key features for identifying steroid users. This aligns with existing literature on the physiological effects of AAS use.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model's performance. The best parameters were identified to maximize accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

## Preliminary Results

The Random Forest model achieved 100% accuracy in classifying AAS users, demonstrating its potential for use in anti-doping systems. The feature importance analysis highlighted key physiological indicators that are strongly associated with AAS use, consistent with scientific literature. The model's ability to accurately classify users based on these features suggests that the collected data is sufficient for this task.
